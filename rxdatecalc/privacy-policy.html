            <p class="mb-4">
              This privacy policy applies to the RxDateCalc app (hereby referred to as "Application") for mobile devices that was created by Iconic Apps LLC (hereby referred to as "Service Provider") as a Free service. This service is intended for use "AS IS".
            </p>

            <h3 class="mt-5 mb-3">What information does the Application obtain and how is it used?</h3>
            <p class="mb-4">
              The Application does not obtain any information when you download and use it. Registration is not required to use the Application.

              The Service Provider does not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from children. The Service Provider encourages all children to never submit any personally identifiable information through the Application and/or Services. The Service Provider encourage parents and legal guardians to monitor their children's Internet usage and to help enforce this Policy by instructing their children never to provide personally identifiable information through the Application and/or Services without their permission.
